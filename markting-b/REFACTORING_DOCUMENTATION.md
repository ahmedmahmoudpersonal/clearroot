# HubSpot Service Refactoring

This document describes the refactoring of the large `hubspot.service.ts` file into smaller, more maintainable services.

## Overview

The original `hubspot.service.ts` file was **1924 lines** long and contained multiple responsibilities. It has been refactored into **7 smaller services**, each with a specific responsibility.

## New Service Structure

### 1. `hubspot-api.service.ts`

**Responsibility**: Handle all HubSpot API interactions

- API key validation
- Fetching contacts from HubSpot
- Updating contacts in HubSpot
- Deleting contacts from HubSpot
- Retry logic and error handling for API calls

### 2. `contact.service.ts`

**Responsibility**: Local contact management operations

- Saving contacts from HubSpot to database
- Retrieving contacts by various criteria
- Contact count operations
- Database cleanup for contacts

### 3. `duplicate-detection.service.ts`

**Responsibility**: Finding and managing duplicate contacts

- SQL-based duplicate detection by email
- SQL-based duplicate detection by phone
- SQL-based duplicate detection by name + company
- Saving duplicate groups to matching table
- Clearing existing matches

### 4. `progress.service.ts`

**Responsibility**: Progress tracking for long-running operations

- In-memory progress storage
- Progress updates and retrieval
- Progress key management

### 5. `file-generation.service.ts`

**Responsibility**: Generating CSV/Excel reports

- Contact data export to CSV format
- File system operations
- File URL generation

### 6. `matching.service.ts`

**Responsibility**: Managing duplicate groups and merge operations

- Paginated duplicate groups retrieval
- Merge submission logic
- Contact removal from groups
- Group reset operations
- Database cleanup for matching-related tables

### 7. `hubspot.service.ts` (Main Orchestrator)

**Responsibility**: Coordinating the overall workflow

- Orchestrating the fetch process
- Managing action status updates
- Coordinating the finish process
- Handling retries and error scenarios
- Background task management

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
3. **Better Testability**: Each service can be tested independently
4. **Reduced Coupling**: Services interact through well-defined interfaces
5. **Easier Code Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant code
6. **Reusability**: Services can be reused in other parts of the application

## Module Updates

The `hubspot.module.ts` has been updated to include all the new services:

```typescript
providers: [
  HubSpotService,
  HubSpotApiService,
  ContactService,
  DuplicateDetectionService,
  ProgressService,
  FileGenerationService,
  MatchingService,
];
```

## File Structure

```
src/services/
├── hubspot.service.ts              (Main orchestrator - 681 lines)
├── hubspot-api.service.ts          (API operations - 152 lines)
├── contact.service.ts              (Contact management - 85 lines)
├── duplicate-detection.service.ts  (Duplicate detection - 174 lines)
├── progress.service.ts             (Progress tracking - 51 lines)
├── file-generation.service.ts      (File generation - 48 lines)
├── matching.service.ts             (Matching operations - 299 lines)
└── index.ts                        (Service exports)
```

## Dependencies

The services have the following dependency relationships:

- `HubSpotService` depends on all other services
- `DuplicateDetectionService` depends on `ContactService`
- `MatchingService` depends on `ContactService` and `HubSpotApiService`
- Other services are independent

## Migration Impact

This refactoring is backward compatible:

- All existing API endpoints continue to work
- No changes to the database schema
- No changes to the client interface
- Only internal implementation has been reorganized

## Future Improvements

With this new structure, future improvements can be made more easily:

- Add unit tests for each service
- Implement caching in `ContactService`
- Add rate limiting in `HubSpotApiService`
- Implement batch processing optimizations
- Add monitoring and metrics per service
